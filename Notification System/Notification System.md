# Notification System

This project explores a low-level design (LLD) of a notification delivery system using core OOP principles like encapsulation, dependency injection, and modular architecture.

## üéØ Objective

Design a system that:
- Stores user-specific notifications
- Delivers them over multiple channels (email, SMS, push)
- Respects per-user delivery preferences
- Uses extensible and testable object-oriented design

## ‚úÖ What the First Design Did Well

- **Entity Modeling**: Users, preferences, inbox, and notifications were logically broken down  
- **Interface Use**: `NotificationService` abstraction introduced early  
- **Basic Dispatcher**: Centralized multi-channel delivery mechanism  
- **Preferences Logic**: Each service respected individual delivery toggles

### ‚ùå Issues in the First Design

1. **Singleton Abuse**  
   `UserManager` was a static singleton ‚Äî poor lifecycle control, untestable.

2. **Hidden Side Effects**  
   `Inbox.addNotification()` internally triggered dispatching ‚Äî mixed responsibilities.

3. **Tight Coupling**  
   Services hardcoded dependencies (e.g., accessed `UserManager` directly).

4. **No Dependency Injection**  
   Notification services pulled data instead of being fed dependencies.

| Problem                            | Why It‚Äôs a Problem                         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå Singleton `UserManager`         | Global state, anti-pattern, untestable     |
| ‚ùå Dispatcher hidden inside Inbox  | Blurs responsibilities (violates SRP)      |
| ‚ùå Services fetched users directly | Breaks DI, unclear ownership               |
| ‚ùå No orchestration layer          | Dispatch was implicit; no clear coordinator|

### üîß How Final Design Solves It

1. **Replaced Singleton with Repository Interface**  
   Introduced `UserRepository` abstraction and `InMemoryUserRepository` implementation.

2. **Isolated Side Effects**  
   Added `NotificationSender` to explicitly handle inboxing and dispatching.

3. **Dependency Injection**  
   Services take `UserRepository` via constructor ‚Äî fully testable and modular.

4. **Decoupled Dispatcher**  
   Dispatcher accepts a list of services externally; fully pluggable.

| Fix                         | Value in Interview Context                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ `UserRepository`         | Decouples data access, supports mocking       |
| ‚úÖ `NotificationSender`     | Introduces orchestration layer                |
| ‚úÖ DI across services       | Clean ownership, easier to test               |
| ‚úÖ Dispatcher as argument   | Pluggable, swappable logic, easier to extend  |
| ‚úÖ Responsibility separation| Inbox stores; Dispatcher sends ‚Äî no confusion |
