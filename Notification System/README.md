# Notification System

This project explores a low-level design (LLD) of a notification delivery system using core OOP principles like encapsulation, dependency injection, and modular architecture.

## üéØ Objective

Design a system that:
- Stores user-specific notifications
- Delivers them over multiple channels (email, SMS, push)
- Respects per-user delivery preferences
- Uses extensible and testable object-oriented design

## ‚úÖ What the First Design Did Well

- **Entity Modeling**: Users, preferences, inbox, and notifications were logically broken down  
- **Interface Use**: `NotificationService` abstraction introduced early  
- **Basic Dispatcher**: Centralized multi-channel delivery mechanism  
- **Preferences Logic**: Each service respected individual delivery toggles

## ‚ùå Issues in the First Design

1. **Singleton Abuse**  
   `UserManager` was a static singleton ‚Äî poor lifecycle control, untestable.

2. **Hidden Side Effects**  
   `Inbox.addNotification()` internally triggered dispatching ‚Äî mixed responsibilities.

3. **Tight Coupling**  
   Services hardcoded dependencies (e.g., accessed `UserManager` directly).

4. **No Dependency Injection**  
   Notification services pulled data instead of being fed dependencies.

| Problem                            | Why It‚Äôs a Problem                         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå Singleton `UserManager`         | Global state, anti-pattern, untestable     |
| ‚ùå Dispatcher hidden inside Inbox  | Blurs responsibilities (violates SRP)      |
| ‚ùå Services fetched users directly | Breaks DI, unclear ownership               |
| ‚ùå No orchestration layer          | Dispatch was implicit; no clear coordinator|

## üîß How Final Design Solves It

1. **Replaced Singleton with Repository Interface**  
   Introduced `UserRepository` abstraction and `InMemoryUserRepository` implementation.

2. **Isolated Side Effects**  
   Added `NotificationSender` to explicitly handle inboxing and dispatching.

3. **Dependency Injection**  
   Services take `UserRepository` via constructor ‚Äî fully testable and modular.

4. **Decoupled Dispatcher**  
   Dispatcher accepts a list of services externally; fully pluggable.

| Fix                         | Value in Interview Context                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ `UserRepository`         | Decouples data access, supports mocking       |
| ‚úÖ `NotificationSender`     | Introduces orchestration layer                |
| ‚úÖ DI across services       | Clean ownership, easier to test               |
| ‚úÖ Dispatcher as argument   | Pluggable, swappable logic, easier to extend  |
| ‚úÖ Responsibility separation| Inbox stores; Dispatcher sends ‚Äî no confusion |

## üß† FAQs

### üß® How would you handle retries / failures?

Use a decorator (`RetryingNotificationService`) around any `NotificationService`.\
It retries failed sends with a fixed or exponential backoff.

```java
class RetryingNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    private final NotificationService delegate;
    private final int maxRetries;

    public boolean sendNotification(Notification notification) {
        for (int i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
            try {
                return delegate.sendNotification(notification);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Retry
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è How to support partial delivery?

Each `NotificationService` is independent. One channel failing (e.g. email) won‚Äôt block others (e.g. SMS, push).  
Failures are isolated ‚Äî no shared state ‚Äî so partial delivery works out of the box.

Each service can internally log or retry on failure using a simple `try/catch`:

```java
public boolean sendNotification(Notification notification) {
    try {
        // Send logic
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Failed to send via Email");
        return false;
    }
}
```

If tracking is required, we can later modify `Dispatcher.dispatch()` to return a `Map<Channel, Boolean>` result per notification.

### üåÄ What if preferences change mid-dispatch?
Take a snapshot of `Preferences` when creating the `Notification`.
Services read from the snapshot, not the current user state, avoiding mid-flight changes.

### üåç How to scale to millions of users?
Swap `InMemoryUserRepository` with a `DatabaseUserRepository`.
No changes to core logic --- interfaces ensure pluggability.

### ‚è∞ How to add future scheduling?
Add a `scheduledAt` field to `Notification`.
Use a `NotificationQueue` class to poll and dispatch when the time arrives.
