# service-patterns-playground

A personal sandbox for practicing low-level design through real object interactions.

Focus areas:
- Entities, managers, and service orchestration
- Interface-driven design
- Dispatcher patterns and behavioral flow
- Clean, modular object relationships

Not production-grade. Just code to explore system behavior.
